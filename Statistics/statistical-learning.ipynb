    "If we assume that there is a relationship between two or more independent variables, and one dependent variable, we can develop a model to predict the value of the dependent variable, given the values of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a dataset that contains the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sales\n",
    "- Price\n",
    "- Advertising expenditure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can develop a model to predict sales given the product price and advertising expenditure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The independent variables (price and advertising expenditure) can go by different names:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Independent variables\n",
    "- Features\n",
    "- Predictors\n",
    "- Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "And the dependent variable can go by the following names:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dependent variable\n",
    "- Response\n",
    "- Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The independent variables are usually denoted using the symbol $X_{i}$ The subscript i distinguishes each independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subscript i distinguishes each independent variable. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $X_{1}$ might be used for denoting `Sales` and \n",
    "- $X_{2}$ might be used for denoting `Price`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, our model assumes a relationship between `p` predictors and a dependent variable `Y`, in the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y = f(X) + ϵ $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Y`: independent variable\n",
    "- `f`: a fixed unknown function\n",
    "- `X`: p independent variables $X = \\begin{bmatrix}X_1 & X_2\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "- `ϵ`: error term. \n",
    "\n",
    "The error term is independent of `X` and has mean zero. `f` represents the **systematic information** that `X` provides about `Y`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Statistical Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical learning** is a set of approaches for estimating `f`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives of Statistical Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two objectives of statistical learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prediction\n",
    "2. Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have `X` and want to know `Y`, we can estimate (predict) `Y` using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{Y} = \\hat{f}(X)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\hat{Y}$: prediction of $Y$\n",
    "- $\\hat{f}$: estimate of $f$ \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might need to predict the number of sales in a given day, knowing the advertising expenditure and the price. Perhaps, every day we need to move a number of goods from the warehouse, where a large number of goods are stored, to the sales store, where the items are sold, but cannot be used to store a large quantity of goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we are not concerned witht the exact form of $\\hat{f}$ as long as it can provide accurate predictions. But other times, a simpler form of $\\hat{f}$ might be preferred if the accuracy is acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the error $ϵ$, it may contain unmeasured variables and unmeasured variation. $f$ cannot use these unmeasured variables and variation for its prediction. This portion of $ϵ$ is called **irreducible error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "But $ϵ$ also includes some **reductible error** caused by the innacuracy of our estimate. The estimation of $f$ aims to minimize the reductible error. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we are interested in the **relationship** between $X$ and $Y$, but not necesarily for making predictions, but because we need to understand the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might need to find the optimal price and advertising expenditure in order to maximize the company income (sales times price), given a cost function. In this scenario, we cannot treat $\\hat{f}$ as a black box; we need to know its form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other question related to inference could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wich are the most important available predictors.\n",
    "- What is the relation between the independent variable and each predictor. For example, there is a positive relationship between advertising expenditure and sales, and a negative relationship between price and sales.\n",
    "- What form does it take the relationship between $Y$ and each predictor? The form can be linear but usually it's more complicated. \n",
